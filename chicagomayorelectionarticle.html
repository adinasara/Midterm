    <p>Chicago’s historic election for mayor will be decided in a runoff election April 2. Here’s a guide to registering and voting before you head to the polls — or vote early, as mail-in ballots became available Tuesday.</p>
    <p> <b>Can I vote early in the runoff election? </b></p>
    <p>Yes, <a href="https://chicagoelections.com/en/early-voting.html" target="_blank">early voting</a> begins March 15 at what’s known as the Loop Super Site, 175 W. Washington St., and begins March 18 at 50 ward sites. Between Tuesday and March 28 you can also apply to vote by mail, but the Chicago Board of Elections Commissioners recommends applying by March 20 to make sure you get your ballot on time.</p>
    <p> <b>How can I register to vote? </b></p>
    <p>You can <a href="https://ova.elections.il.gov/" target="_blank">register online</a>  by March 17. Tuesday was the deadline to register by mail.If you want to vote early, you can register when you go to any early voting site. You can also register in your precinct polling place on Election Day. Two forms of <a href="https://chicagoelections.com/en/when-you-need-id-to-vote.html" target="_blank">identification</a> are required to register in person, and one ID needs to show your current address.If you’re already getting a new driver’s license or state ID at an <a href="https://www.ilsos.gov/facilityfinder/facility" target="_blank">Illinois secretary of state’s office,</a>  you can register to vote at the same time until March 17.To be eligible to vote, you must be 18 years or older, a U.S. citizen and have lived in your voting precinct for at least 30 days before Election Day.</p>
    <p> <b>If I voted in the November midterm election, do I need to register again?</b></p>
    <p>You only need to register again if you’ve moved recently or changed your name, according to the Board of Election Commissioners. If you moved before March 4, you’ll need to update your registration to your new precinct. If you moved on or after March 4, you can still vote in your previous precinct. You can find out if you’re already registered to vote on the board’s site.</p>
    <p><b>I’m already registered to vote at my current address. Do I need to bring my ID?</b></p>
    <p>You don’t have to have identification with you, but you might want to bring it just in case. <a href="https://chicagoelections.com/en/when-you-need-id-to-vote.html" target="_blank">You may need to show</a>  it if your signature doesn’t match the one they have on file or if election judges question your right to vote.</p>
    <p>“Sometimes, the person’s current signature might not match their registration from a decade or more ago,” Chicago Board of Election Commissioners spokesperson Jim Allen said in an email in February. “ID helps in that situation.”You may also need it if you mailed in your registration and didn’t provide your Social Security number or driver’s license number.If you didn’t bring your ID and there’s a question about your registration, you can still cast a provisional ballot. For the vote to be counted, you’ll need to present your ID to the Chicago election board within a week of the election.</p>
    <p><b>Who’s on the ballot?</b></p>
    <p>Chicago voters will elect the next mayor, deciding between former federal prosecutor Lori Lightfoot and Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle. Ten Chicago aldermanic elections went to <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/politics/elections/ct-met-chicago-election-by-numbers-20190227-story.html" target="_blank">a runoff election,</a>  as did the race for Chicago’s treasurer.Want to find out more about the candidates and what’s at stake? Check out the Tribune’s voting guide.</p>
    <p><b>Is my polling place accessible?</b></p>
    <p>Most locations have made accommodations for people with disabilities, but some might have features that aren’t fully accessible, according to Allen. If your precinct polling place is not accessible to you, you can request curbside voting outside of the building.If you need help with voting, you can ask someone you trust to help you cast the ballot. Both you and the person assisting you will need to sign an affidavit. You can also ask two election judges to help you cast the ballot, <a href="https://chicagoelections.com/en/accessibility-voters-with-disabilities.html" target="_blank">according to the Chicago Board of Election Commissioners.</a> </p>
    <p><b>Can I bring my kid into the voting booth?</b></p>
    <p>Yes, children under 18 can enter the voting booth with you.</p>
    <p><b>What can I bring with me into the voting booth?</b></p>
    <p>If you’d like to bring notes to remember which candidates you planned to vote for — or an old-fashioned party palm card — feel free. You can get a sample ballot online to make sure you know what to expect ahead of time. You can also take your smartphone in the booth and check the internet for information, according to Allen. However, he wrote — “don’t make a call to talk about candidates in the polling place.”</p>
    <p><b>Can I take a voting selfie?</b></p>
    <p>In some states, it’s legal to take photographs in voting booths, but Allen said that “the courts have given different answers on that question” in Illinois. By law, Illinois makes it a Class 4 felony for “any person who knowingly marks his ballot or casts his vote on a voting machine or voting device so that it can be observed by another person.” “We discourage (taking a photo) strictly to avoid violating the secrecy of other people’s ballots,” Allen said in the email.</p>
    <p><b>Can I talk to my friend in the voting booth next to me?</b></p>
    <p>You can, but not about the election. That could be considered “electioneering,” which is prohibited at polling places.“It’s electioneering to start discussing the candidates, the issues, the ads, the endorsements, the debates, etc., in the polling place,” Allen wrote.</p>
